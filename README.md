# J124 Final Project: UC Berkeley admissions by ethnicity
## By Matthew Yoshimoto
### Data Analysis Process 
The first step of my analysis was to join the [data from UC Berkeleyâ€™s admissions from 2012 to 2022](https://www.google.com/](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/about-us/information-center/admissions-source-school)) onto one spreadsheet. I next inserted a column of the admissions year to the left of each school name. To clean my data, I had to unmerge the combined cells and then use the [array formula](https://infoinspired.com/google-docs/spreadsheet/fill-merged-cells-in-google-sheets/) to fill the merged cells down. This made it so that the schools and cities were now listed in every row. At this point, I could begin my data analysis. <br/>

This is the [data set I analyzed in Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oYrYav8eZLnbJ14ZFdc4DFqpaceefVChhTK2Kuado08/edit#gid=0).
